# DOMINOES
DePaul Software Development Senior Capstone Project

Welcome to the code repository for our senior capstone project.

The idea of the project is to demonstrate how we can leverage a blockchain in order to create an inmutable cannonical ledger for medical records.

## TODO
- adapt the mock blockchian such that it works for the specific usage of medical record keeping
- create a CLI that connects and interracts with our blokchain
- give CLI ability for patients and providers to add/look at records according to their permissions
- create a web interface that mimicks what the CLI does

## Concept
Go into the 'mockchain' directory to look at our concept demo.
