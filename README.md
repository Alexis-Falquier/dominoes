# DOMINOES
DePaul Software Development Senior Capstone Project

Welcome to the code repository for our senior capstone project.
Please refer to our project website for information about our members:

The idea of the project is to demonstrate how we can leverage a blockchain in order to create an inmutable cannonical ledger for medical records.

## Run Your Own Dominoes Chain

Go into the dominoechain directory and follow the instructions on how to deploy your own chain. Feel free to clone and adapt the code to run your own unique version of a basic blockchain.

## CLI

Once you have a dominoes chain running, use the CLI to interract with it. Go into the cli directory for more information.

## FrontEnd

We set up a basic front end react app, to show how we invision a doctor would interract with our chain.
